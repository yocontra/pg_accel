# Benchmark Failure Ledger

Release-blocking gate failures and every measured row still below PostgreSQL-parallel parity. Rows are merged by workload/scale so one benchmark cell has one owner even when it trips multiple checks.

| Total rows | Ship-gate failures | H3 gate failures | Crashes | Rows below parity | GPU-dispatched below parity | Native below parity | Planner-declined below parity | Stock fallback rows | Custom Scan no-dispatch | Work items |
